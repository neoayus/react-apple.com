# Apple.com clone (React)

***live link: https://neoclone.netlify.app/*** 
i still got some minor tweaks, refactors and stylin issues to deal with, tho that for later, i'm through this...


The goal of this project is to take an old **HTML/CSS/JS design** (originally designed in Figma) and rebuild it using **modern React practices**, focusing on:
- component-based architecture
- reusable UI elements
- clean layout composition
- scalable structure for future animations and interactions

This is **not finished yet**.

##  Project Status

**In progress**  
Core layout and components are being implemented first.  
Animations, accessibility improvements, and advanced interactions will be added later.
