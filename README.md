# Apple.com clone (React)

This is a **work-in-progress** React rewrite of an Apple.com–style landing page.

The goal of this project is to take an old **HTML/CSS/JS design** (originally designed in Figma) and rebuild it using **modern React practices**, focusing on:
- component-based architecture
- reusable UI elements
- clean layout composition
- scalable structure for future animations and interactions

This is **not finished yet**.
